**Catch the Hope** is a collection styled game on a project with the theme of HOPE. This is a project I did through the **Girls Who Code** program

**Mechanics:** bird and falling bean.
The user need to keep clicking to keep the bird flying in the sky which symbolizes that our life will gets better if we have hope in our heart.
